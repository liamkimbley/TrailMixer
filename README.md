### Intro
Hiking has become a staple in the social life of those living close to the mountains. With so many people heading to the hills, why not bring them together? TrailMixer is a full-stack, match-making application designed to help people make new connections, all while going for a hike!

### How It Works
Your TrailMixer experience starts when you let us know what kind of hike interests you. From there, you will see a list of trails that match up to your desires. Finally, you can see the other people who are interested in hiking the same trail and plan a hike together!

You are encouraged to browse our database of trails on your own as well. With our search tool, you can filter through different trails to find the right hike for you.

Groups are also very flexible. For example, you can socialize with a large group while you hike, challenge yourself on a treacherous path with a group of experienced climbers, or enjoy a scenic view with your date.
